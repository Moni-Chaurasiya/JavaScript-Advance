<!-- API (Application Programming Interface): An API is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It allows different software systems to communicate with each other. -->

<!-- API Request: When you send an API request, you are essentially asking a server to perform a task or provide data. In the case of a GET request, you are requesting data from a server. The server processes your request and sends back a response, which can be data or a confirmation of the requested operation. -->

<!-- V8 Engine: V8 is a high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google. It is open-source and used primarily in Google Chrome and Node.js. -->

<!-- Features of V8: -->

<!-- Execution of JavaScript: V8 compiles JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, which allows it to execute JavaScript quickly and efficiently. -->

<!-- Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT): V8 uses JIT compilation to improve performance. It compiles the JavaScript code to native machine code before executing it, rather than interpreting it line by line. -->

<!-- Memory Management: V8 includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory, freeing up space occupied by objects that are no longer in use. -->

<!-- Optimizations: V8 employs various optimization techniques to make JavaScript execution faster, such as inline caching and hidden classes. -->
